My name is Fanie Reynders. I am a technical consultant, technology evangelist and Microsoft C# MVP that is obsessed with code, architecture and cool new tech. Activities I enjoy, other than my day job, are programming, speaking, tweeting and blogging.

I'm a big fan of social coding, so you are guaranteed to find me at places like [GitHub](https://github.com/faniereynders) and [CoderBits](http://coderbits.com/faniereynders).

Feel free to contact me on Twitter ([@FanieReynders](https://twitter.com/faniereynders)), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin/faniereynders) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/faniereynders). If you like what I write about, feel free to subscribe to my feed.
