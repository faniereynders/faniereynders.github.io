In this episode of GeekFest I talk to F# enthusiast Huw Simpson about the basics of F#. He gives us the run down on why functional programming is becoming the new kid on the block and how easy it is to start learning a new language like F#.

[I've wrote about a functional client-side language]({% post_url 2014-01-07-clouds-in-my-coffeescript %}) before and as a C# junkie, not having all my semi-colons and curly braces in place, just feels incomplete, but I do like the simplicity and conciseness of F# as a language: It's much more declarative than C# and more natural, without the noise of punctuation. Like I've mentioned in the video, it's almost like the good old VB days all over again. :)

With fewer keywords and white-space to indicate the body of functions and classes it is a bit of a learning curve at first, but once you get your hands dirty it will be downhill from there.

I Hope that you will find this video useful and that it will give you that little extra nudge you need to start learning a whole new exciting language, like F#. Here are some links to get you started:

We will definitely have Huw on the show again in the near future so please leave your comments on the show below.
