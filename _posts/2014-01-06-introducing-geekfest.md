For quite some time I’ve been meaning to start a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_blog" target="_blank">video blog</a> (or <a href="http://t.co/RQ3eaxkIYx" target="_blank">vlog</a>) on interesting subjects and people so I’ve decided to waste no more time and get to work on a new series called GeekFest, a screencast for developers by developers.

###1 – Schedulers in WAMS

The first episode of this series we will explore schedulers in <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/mobile-services/" target="_blank">Windows Azure Mobile Services (WAMS)</a>. I know there are most probably tons of video tutorials out there on this subject but I did notice that the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services/Windows-Store-app-Getting-Started-with-the-Windows-Azure-Mobile-Services-Scheduler" target="_blank">official one on the Channel 9 site</a> (at the time of this post) is a bit out of date – as it is still referring to the obsolete Twitter v1 API.

[I’ve blogged about this before]({% post_url 2013-06-20-using-twitter-rest-api-v11-from-azure %}) but figured it would be fun doing a screen cast on this as well. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did when I made it.

*Until next time!*
