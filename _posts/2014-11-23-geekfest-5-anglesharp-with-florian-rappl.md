There are a few good HTML &amp; CSS parsing libraries out there, but <a href="https://github.com/FlorianRappl/AngleSharp">AngleSharp</a> definitely stands out among them by giving .NET developers all the same possibilities of modern browsers using JavaScript. In this fifth episode of GeekFest, <a href="http://www.florian-rappl.de/">Florian Rappl</a> takes us through what AngleSharp actually is and why it is not "just another <a href="http://www.zenmeo.com/wordpress/what-is-headless-browser-the-list-of-headless-browser/">head-less browser</a>". He briefly outlines some <a href="https://github.com/FlorianRappl/AngleSharp/wiki/Performance">impressive performance metrics</a> of this portable class library and takes us through some cool features like built-in CSS parsing and DOM querying.

Although the library hasn't reached it's official 1.0 release yet, it's fully extendable from the get-go and the project is already <a href="https://github.com/FlorianRappl/AngleSharp/pulls">inviting pull-requests on GitHub</a>. You can also <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/AngleSharp/">grab it from Nuget</a>.
