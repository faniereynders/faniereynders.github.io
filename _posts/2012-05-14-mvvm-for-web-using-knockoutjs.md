Ever since the explosion of web-oriented apps, the need for doing complex things simpler becomes more obvious. Creating richer & more sophisticated UI's usually involves using JavaScript API's like JQuery, but a new MVVM library has emerged especially for the web...

<!--more-->

###What?
Knockout.js is an open-source JavaScript library (yep, not Microsoft - licensed under the MIT) that helps you create rich, responsive display & editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model.

Any time you have sections of your UI that update automatically, Knockout.js can help you implement it in a simpler, more maintainable fashion.

###Why?
The problem with designing for the web is that rich user interactivity is fairly hard to do. Even when using a JavaScript library (like JQuery) it can become quite cumbersome. Before you know it, you have a mess of inter-related event handlers that all pretty much do the same thing.

Now, with Knockout, we can say hello to more structured code based on true object orientation & declarative bindings. This means that Knockout brings the MVVM pattern comes to the web.

Like any other good JavaScript library, Knockout also supports a wide variety of browsers like IE 6+, FireFox 2+, Chrome, Safari &amp; Opera.

Knockout can be added on top of your existing web application without requiring major architectural changes. Developers familiar with Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, or other MV* technologies may see MVVM as a real-time form of MVC with declarative syntax. In another sense, you can think of KO as a general way to make UIs for editing JSON dataâ€¦ whatever works for you :)

###How?
The best way of explaining Knockout.js is to actually show you. In order to keep this post short & sweet and on to the point - <a href="http://learn.knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">here's a link to the interactive tutorials</a> found on the website - <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">knockoutjs.com</a>

> I've uploaded an simple example based on my demo on [~~SkyDrive~~ OneDrive](https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=4f6380499064f637&amp;resid=4F6380499064F637!196&amp;parid=4F6380499064F637!195)

Enjoy experimenting &amp; happy Knocking!<
